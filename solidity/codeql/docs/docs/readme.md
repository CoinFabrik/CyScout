# CyScout

## Run queries and detect vulnerabilities in your smart contracts using CodeQL-Solidity

![alt text](../static/img/output.gif)

This repository contains CoinFabrik's ongoing research and development to extend CodeQL support to the Solidity smart contract language. By leveraging the foundational work done by the CodeQL team for Ruby, we have adapted and expanded their approach to create a powerful toolset for analyzing Solidity code.

## üîç Overview

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools for querying and detecting vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. We build upon the work of [Joran Honig's Solidity Tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/JoranHonig/tree-sitter-solidity) and the CodeQL team's [Ruby implementation](https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/code-scanning-and-ruby-turning-source-code-into-a-queryable-database/). The project includes an extractor, database schema generation, and abstractions such as a cleaner Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG), and Dataflow analysis. These elements enable complex vulnerability detection and querying, similar to the C++ libraries in CodeQL.

## üöÄ Project Status

- **Extractor and Database Schema**: Usable and functional for Solidity codebases.
- **Current Work**: We are actively developing a cleaner AST, CFG, and Dataflow support to enhance the detection of vulnerabilities.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Nine simple detector examples are provided to demonstrate basic usage and potential.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with analyzing Solidity smart contracts using CodeQL, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install CodeQL CLI

First, download and install the CodeQL CLI by following the instructions provided in the [official CodeQL CLI repository](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries).

> Remember to add the CodeQL CLI to your PATH.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting up Solidity Extractor

- Go to `CyScout/solidity/codeql/extractor-pack/tools` and give all `.sh` files execute permissions. This is:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

- Copy the `CyScout/solidity/codeql/ql/lib/solidity` and `CyScout/solidity/codeql/solidity-test` folders of this repository (`cyscout`) inside `CodeQL CLI repository` and `CodeQL`. Both at root level.

- Inside `CodeQL` repository, in this path `codeql/solidity` run:

```shell
bash scripts/create-extractor-pack.sh
```

You should see

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Solidity Code

To create a CodeQL database from a Solidity codebase, run the following command:

```shell
codeql database create /path-to-database/ -l solidity -s /path-to-solidity-codebase/ --search-path /path-to-[solidity/extractor-pack]/
```

If all went smoothly, you should see something of the kind:

```shell

codeql database create /home/user/codeql/solidity-test/test-db-bitshift-examples -l solidity -s /home/user/codeql/solidity-test/bitshift-order-test --search-path ../solidity/extractor-pack --overwrite

```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Sample Detectors

Once the database is created, you can run sample detectors written in the QL language:

```bash
codeql query run /path-to-detector/ -d /path-to-created-database/
```

For instance:

```shell
[1/1] Found in cache: /home/user/codeql/solidity/ql/lib/detector3.ql.
detector3.ql: Evaluation completed (191ms).
|      col0       |                                     col1                                     |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| YulFunctionCall | /home/user/codeql/solidity-test/bitshift-order-test/vulnerable.sol@4:18:4:26 |

```

| 4   | `bad-prng` | Detects bad randomness            |
| 5   | `divide-before-multiply` | Detects loss of precision  |
| 6   | `incorrect-exp` | Detects use of bitwise xor instead of exponential   |
| 7   | `unchecked-send` | The return value of a send is not checked    |
| 8   | `is-unreachable` | Detects dead code   |
| 9   | `unprotected-self-destruct` | Detects unprotected call to selfdestruct/suicidal   |
